contractors.The guidance builds on our user research
principles. It also builds on the
guidance for user research in the GDS Service Manual
so we can help teams meet the Government
Service Standard.Some of the guidance explains how to do user research in an effective, ethical
and legal way. If your situation isn’t covered, and you’re not sure what to do,
ask Coca Rivas, Director of Design, or John Waterworth, Principal Researcher.">

      <ul>
        <li data-title="User research workflow" data-content="These are the things that user researchers usually do on projects.
  
    Support sales and scheduling

    Researchers contribute to client proposals and scheduling projects. We advise
on research activities to include in proposals, join in pitch presentations
and help with scheduling decisions.

    This helps dxw to win good work that delivers valuable results for our
clients, for users and for ourselves.
  
  
    Help setup the project and team

    Researchers get involved with project inception and planning. We review
existing evidence. And we create research plans that show what we’ll do, why
and how we’ll do it. We make sure the plan is achievable and allows us to do
research at a sustainable pace.

    This helps teams to focus on understanding and meeting the needs of users,
and to produce the best results with the people, time and resources we have.

    How we create and use research plans
  
  
    Recruit people for research

    Researchers recruit appropriate participants for research activities. Finding
the right participants at the right time is always challenging, so we start
recruiting as soon as we can and use a variety of approaches to reach
everyone we need. We keep track of who participates in our research, so we
can be confident that we’re including the right people.

    This helps teams to learn about all their users and produce services that
work well for everyone.

    How we get informed consent for user research

    When and how we give incentives to research participants

    How we protect participant privacy
  
  
    Plan and do research activities

    This is the most obvious and visible part of our work. We choose research
activities that provide strong evidence and reliable answers, for the least
time, effort and cost. And we choose activities that help our teams and
different kinds of users to participate.

    We record what we do and how we do it, for each other, and for those who come
after us.

    This helps teams to embed regular research into their agile practices and get
the best results from the effort they put in.

    How we create and use research plans

    How we write and use discussion guides

    How we take notes and record research sessions
  
  
    Analyse research and produce findings

    Researchers carefully analyse the different kinds of data we collect. We
analyse data in batches and record our findings from sprint to sprint. And we
involve our colleagues and clients in analysis to make sure our findings are
clear and relevant.

    This helps teams understand, believe in and act quickly on what they learn.
  
  
    Help teams make good decisions

    Researchers produce findings and other recommendations that help teams make
good decisions about what to do next and how to approach it. We get actively
involved in identifying opportunities, creating design ideas and setting
priorities.

    This helps teams to create great services that work well for users, and to
strike a balance between short-term wins and more complex, long term changes.
  
  
    Create and share outputs

    Researchers create and share formal outputs like plans, presentations,
reports and diagrams. These record and communicate the important things we
learn. We create finished outputs from sprint to sprint, not just at the end
of a project. And we think carefully about how we present and share these
outputs to produce the most impact.

    This helps our clients and other stakeholders use and benefit from what we
learned both during the project and long after we’ve gone.

    How we share research activities and findings
  
  
    Take care of research data

    Researchers know it’s important to manage research data carefully. We follow
our privacy policy and
ISO27001 certification when
collecting, processing and storing research data to make sure we comply with
that
General Data Protection Regulation.

    This helps teams to get the most from the research data they collect, while
protecting the privacy of the people taking part.

        <li data-title="Good practices to follow" data-content="
  
    Capture only what you need and have consent for

    Good user research practice, and good privacy practice, is to capture only
the data you believe you need. For example, don’t make a screen or video
recording, ‘just in case’, if you’ll only ever need a transcript of what the
participant says.

    Make sure that anything you capture during a session is covered by the
consent you’ve collected. If a participant changes their mind about what they
consent to, be prepared to not make, or to delete recordings you no longer
have consent for.
  
  
    Do not use your personal devices

    Always use a dxw provided device, rather than your personal device, when
taking notes and photos, or making recordings.

    Using our own devices in research means that personal data about research
participants can be mixed into our personal data stores, like cloud photo
libraries. And also runs the risk of participants, client staff and
colleagues seeing our personal messages and images.
  
  
    Keep your notes and recordings secure

    As soon as possible after the session, transfer any notes and recordings from
paper and other devices to your dxw provided laptop. And from your laptop to
the dxw Google Drive or to the client’s research store.

    Keep only anonymised notes, quotes and images in tools like Miro and Trello.
  
  
    Have a fall back

    The one certainty in user research is that things go wrong. So make sure you
have other options to capture what you need.

    For example:

    
      The participant may decide they don’t want to be recorded in a particular
way, so be prepared to switch from video to an audio-only recording, or to
just take notes
      Your preferred device, app or service may not be working properly, so have
an alternative like a paper notebook
      Your note taker, assistant or observer may not be able to join the session,
so be prepared to take notes and recordings yourself
    

    Note that if the participant refuses all recording, including note taking,
you may want to abandon the session.

          <h1>How we do user research</h1>
          <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This guide explains how we do user research at dxw.</p>

<p>The guidance applies to all user researchers employed by dxw, both staff and
contractors.</p>

<p>The guidance builds on our user research
<a href="/#user-research-principles">principles</a>. It also builds on the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research">guidance for user research in the GDS Service Manual</a>
so we can help teams meet the Government
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Service Standard</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the guidance explains how to do user research in an effective, ethical
and legal way. If your situation isn’t covered, and you’re not sure what to do,
ask Coca Rivas, Director of Design, or John Waterworth, Principal Researcher.</p>

<h2 id="user-research-workflow">User research workflow</h2>

<p>These are the things that user researchers usually do on projects.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Support sales and scheduling</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers contribute to client proposals and scheduling projects. We advise
on research activities to include in proposals, join in pitch presentations
and help with scheduling decisions.</p>

    <p>This helps dxw to win good work that delivers valuable results for our
clients, for users and for ourselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Help setup the project and team</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers get involved with project inception and planning. We review
existing evidence. And we create research plans that show what we’ll do, why
and how we’ll do it. We make sure the plan is achievable and allows us to do
research at a sustainable pace.</p>

    <p>This helps teams to focus on understanding and meeting the needs of users,
and to produce the best results with the people, time and resources we have.</p>

    <p><a href="#how-we-create-and-use-research-plans">How we create and use research plans</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recruit people for research</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers recruit appropriate participants for research activities. Finding
the right participants at the right time is always challenging, so we start
recruiting as soon as we can and use a variety of approaches to reach
everyone we need. We keep track of who participates in our research, so we
can be confident that we’re including the right people.</p>

    <p>This helps teams to learn about all their users and produce services that
work well for everyone.</p>

    <p><a href="#how-we-protect-participant-privacy">How we protect participant privacy</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Plan and do research activities</strong></p>

    <p>This is the most obvious and visible part of our work. We choose research
activities that provide strong evidence and reliable answers, for the least
time, effort and cost. And we choose activities that help our teams and
different kinds of users to participate.</p>

    <p>We record what we do and how we do it, for each other, and for those who come
after us.</p>

    <p>This helps teams to embed regular research into their agile practices and get
the best results from the effort they put in.</p>

    <p><a href="#how-we-take-notes-and-record-research-sessions">How we take notes and record research sessions</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Analyse research and produce findings</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers carefully analyse the different kinds of data we collect. We
analyse data in batches and record our findings from sprint to sprint. And we
involve our colleagues and clients in analysis to make sure our findings are
clear and relevant.</p>

    <p>This helps teams understand, believe in and act quickly on what they learn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Help teams make good decisions</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers produce findings and other recommendations that help teams make
good decisions about what to do next and how to approach it. We get actively
involved in identifying opportunities, creating design ideas and setting
priorities.</p>

    <p>This helps teams to create great services that work well for users, and to
strike a balance between short-term wins and more complex, long term changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create and share outputs</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers create and share formal outputs like plans, presentations,
reports and diagrams. These record and communicate the important things we
learn. We create finished outputs from sprint to sprint, not just at the end
of a project. And we think carefully about how we present and share these
outputs to produce the most impact.</p>

    <p>This helps our clients and other stakeholders use and benefit from what we
learned both during the project and long after we’ve gone.</p>

    <p><a href="#how-we-share-research-activities-and-findings">How we share research activities and findings</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Take care of research data</strong></p>

    <p>Researchers know it’s important to manage research data carefully. We follow
our <a href="https://www.dxw.com/privacy-statement/">privacy policy</a> and
<a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001">ISO27001 certification</a> when
collecting, processing and storing research data to make sure we comply with
that
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a>.</p>

    <p>This helps teams to get the most from the research data they collect, while
protecting the privacy of the people taking part.</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-we-name-and-identify-documents">How we name and identify documents</h2>

<p>It’s important that team members and stakeholders know they have the right
research plan, discussion guide or other research document.</p>

<p>So we give our documents consistent file names like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>YYYY MM DD - TYPE - CLIENT - PROJECT - RESEARCH ACTIVITY (if needed for
clarity)</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2019 10 01 - Research plan - Southwark - Affordable homes monitoring alpha</li>
</ul>

<p>And a consistent front cover with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Client and dxw logos</li>
  <li>Client and project names</li>
  <li>Document type</li>
  <li>Date</li>
  <li>Main contact (who wrote it)</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Southwark Council</li>
  <li>Affordable homes monitoring alpha</li>
  <li>User research plan</li>
  <li>(Draft)</li>
  <li>1 October 2019</li>
  <li>John Waterworth</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-we-create-and-use-research-plans">How we create and use research plans</h2>

<h3 id="planning-research-activities">Planning research activities</h3>

<p>It’s important that we carefully plan the research we do.</p>

<p>Teams create the best services when research activities provide reliable answers
to their most important questions. And we do our best research when we do it in
ethical, inclusive and sustainable ways.</p>

<p>We want to involve our colleagues and other stakeholders in creating research
plans, so they understand and can contribute to research activities.</p>

<p>And we want to create plans that allow us to
<a href="https://playbook.dxw.com/#user-research-principles">learn, share and adapt</a> as
we go.</p>

<p>The guide to
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/plan-user-research-for-your-service">planning user research for your service</a>
in the Service Manual sets out a good approach to creating a plan.</p>

<h3 id="research-plan-template">Research plan template</h3>

<p>Creating and sharing a short research plan document is a great way to get
everyone aligned. And to address any concerns that clients and stakeholders may
have.</p>

<p>We have a
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11olKOHluGXL8OA-XKIvSXXsCxQ3dvOUgSUgJSw0qLm4/">research plan template</a>
that you can use as a starting point. But feel free to adapt it and add sections
that may be important for your project.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-do-research-safely-during-coronavirus">How we do research safely during coronavirus</h2>

<p>We have a responsibility to keep ourselves and our participants safe and comply
with government guidance during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. In
particular, we should carefully consider whether and how to do any face to face
research.</p>

<p>For now, you will need the approval of a Director, Head or Principal Researcher
to do face to face research. And you must document your decision and your
assessment of the risks in your
<a href="#how-we-create-and-use-research-plans">research plan</a>.</p>

<p>The Service Manual has a guide to
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/doing-user-research-during-coronavirus-covid-19-choosing-face-to-face-or-remote-research">choosing face to face or remote research</a>,
and what to include when you document your decision and your assessment of the
risks.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-write-and-use-discussion-guides">How we write and use discussion guides</h2>

<p>We create discussion guides to help us plan and do research activities, like
interviews, visits, workshops and usability tests.</p>

<p>They help us to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identify the purpose of the research activity and what we want to get from it</li>
  <li>review planned activities with team members and stakeholders so we stay
aligned with project goals</li>
  <li>stay on track during research sessions</li>
  <li>make sure different researchers cover the same topics so participants have a
consistent experience</li>
  <li>keep a record of what we did in each research activity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-parts-of-a-discussion-guide">The parts of a discussion guide</h3>

<h4 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h4>

<p>Recap the goals of the project and the research activity, describe the methods
you’ll be using, and set out the overall structure of the research session.</p>

<h4 id="preparation">Preparation</h4>

<p>Describe anything the researcher needs to have or do, to prepare for the
session. Reference things like the information sheet to send to participants,
describe how to set up the prototype you’ll be testing, and reference the
<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MAUax08jwwqNd1BWfH-gixSbltY2qE-m">notes template</a>
you want to use.</p>

<h4 id="welcome">Welcome</h4>

<p>Set out the things you’ll say to the participant to let them them know what’s
going on and make sure they feel comfortable. It can be helpful to write this
out word for word, so you have something to fall back on when you’re tired, or
get interrupted or distracted.</p>

<p>In your welcome you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Say thank you</strong> - Start off by letting the participant know you appreciate
them offering their time (incentivised or not)</li>
  <li><strong>Introduce yourself</strong> - Let them know your name, role, company and who you
are working for</li>
  <li><strong>State your relationship to the client</strong> - We are <strong>independent
researchers</strong>, working on behalf of a client</li>
  <li><strong>Summarise the research purpose</strong> - Explain what you’re trying to find out,
eg We’re interested in how you recruit teachers for your school</li>
  <li><strong>Remind them it is voluntary</strong> - They can choose to stop at any time</li>
  <li><strong>Reassure tham that there are no right or wrong answers</strong> - We’re interested
in how the participant thinks and what influences that</li>
  <li><strong>Ask them to be honest</strong> - As researchers we won’t be offended by any
comments, we just want to find out what people really think about a service
and how it might be improved</li>
  <li><strong>Describe how the session will go</strong> - Let the participant know who is taking
notes or observing, how you are recording the session, how long the session
will take, and what you’ll be doing in that time, so the participant knows
what to expect</li>
  <li><strong>Check consent and non-disclosure</strong> - Has this been done? Do they have any
questions?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="topics-tasks-and-activities">Topics, tasks and activities</h4>

<p>Have a section in your guide for each of the main interview topics, test tasks
or workshop activities.</p>

<p>For each one write out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What you are trying to learn</li>
  <li>For an interview topic, the starter questions you’ll ask along with likely
follow ups</li>
  <li>For a test task or workshop activity
    <ul>
      <li>the steps to do</li>
      <li>explanations and instructions for participants, such asking them to think
out loud during a test so you can understand what’s happening</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How long the topic, task or activity is likely to take</li>
  <li>The priority - is this essential, or could you leave it out if you’re short of
time</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h4>

<p>Describe how the researcher should conclude the session with the participant.
This can include asking the participant for their final thoughts, asking them
how the session went for them, letting them know what will happen next, and
thanking them for their time.</p>

<p>Also include any steps for the researcher, like collecting and storing
recordings, or deleting data from prototypes.</p>

<h3 id="three-discussion-guide-templates">Three discussion guide templates</h3>

<p>We have template discussion guides for three different kinds of research
activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XeBhmQL0jqFFsl2Cw-DOKVpabTRILGl-TjeyUDW90vM">Interviews and contextual research</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hcVkLGJVDB9ZOoMIz93erUpk1RUgXN_ZcZflJxsFpHw">Usability tests</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZHZwLBnUlDsxrvv1qj_ZpFU9QGsP_dIDLMVcGbEYswY">Workshops</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-we-share-research-activities-and-findings">How we share research activities and findings</h2>

<p>We regularly share descriptions of research activities and findings in show and
tells, reports and other places.</p>

<h3 id="slide-layouts-for-research">Slide layouts for research</h3>

<p>When presenting about research, we use one of the dxw Proposal Deck Templates.
These have all the kinds of slide layouts you will need.</p>

<p>You can find these in the Google Slides
<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/?folder=0AGsaGhY-i-mIUk9PVA&amp;ftv=1">Template Gallery</a>.</p>

<h3 id="presenting-research-activities">Presenting research activities</h3>

<p>When sharing what we plan to do or what we’ve been doing, we talk about research
activities rather than research methods.</p>

<p>Descriptions of research activities look like:</p>

<p>We did <em>some kind of research</em> with <em>some kinds of participants</em> to learn
<em>something the team needs to know</em>.</p>

<p>We avoid using research jargon that our colleagues might not understand. For
example, rather than talking about ‘ethnography’ or ‘contextual enquiry’ we
might say that “we visited the support desk and observed the team helping people
with their applications”.</p>

<h3 id="presenting-research-findings">Presenting research findings</h3>

<p>When sharing findings, we always make the finding the headline. Then follow up
with supporting evidence, explanation and illustration.</p>

<p>You can read more about this in the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/sharing-user-research-findings#presenting-your-findings">Sharing user research findings guide</a>
in the Service Manual.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-get-informed-consent-for-user-research">How we get informed consent for user research</h2>

<p>You must have informed consent from participants before you start any research
activity with them. And you must then act only within the consent the
participant has given.</p>

<p>This guidance explains how we collect and keep evidence of informed consent at
dxw. It builds on the general guidance on
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research">getting informed consent</a>
in the Service Manual.</p>

<h3 id="creating-consent-materials">Creating consent materials</h3>

<h4 id="using-dxw-or-client-consent-materials">Using dxw or client consent materials</h4>

<p>There are two basic options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The simplest and best option is to use our client’s existing consent
materials. If they don’t have any, we can work with the client to create
consent materials for the project, that the client can then reuse in future.</p>

    <p>In this case the client will manage all the research data we collect and keep
the associated records of consent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If using the client’s consent materials is not possible, or if the client
asks us to do confidential research, we can use the dxw
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=19lm5_gzzqzVP0NnNZZiqPhEwW2_i2bkI5apAaie4-4M">information sheet</a>
and
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k">consent form</a>
templates.</p>

    <p>In this case dxw will manage the research data and keep the associated
records of consent.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Which ever approach you take, make sure your consent materials and process
follow the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research#what-informed-consent-is">good practice for informed consent</a>
described in the Service Manual.</p>

<h4 id="creating-an-information-sheet">Creating an information sheet</h4>

<p>For each round or batch of research you do, you should create a specific
information sheet that describes the research you are doing, and gives the
participant the information they need.</p>

<p>You can use the same information sheet for several rounds or batches of
research, as long as you are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>doing the research for the same purpose</li>
  <li>doing the same things during the sessions</li>
  <li>collecting the same research data</li>
  <li>working with the same third-party organisations and suppliers</li>
</ul>

<p>We have
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=19lm5_gzzqzVP0NnNZZiqPhEwW2_i2bkI5apAaie4-4M">template information sheets</a>
to use for the most common research situations.</p>

<h4 id="creating-a-consent-form">Creating a consent form</h4>

<p>If you are using a client’s consent form, make sure it clearly describes dxw’s
involvement in the research, and how we will share research data and findings.</p>

<p>We have
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k">template consent forms</a>
for the most common research situations.</p>

<p>If none of the standard consent forms will work for the research activities you
are doing, speak to the Head of User Research.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-your-consent-materials-and-process">Sharing your consent materials and process</h3>

<p>Some clients and stakeholders will not understand the ethical and legal reasons
for getting informed consent, and will not be familiar with good consent
practice.</p>

<p>To avoid problems later, share your consent materials and process as soon as you
can with the client and with any organisations whose staff or members you are
researching with.</p>

<h3 id="collecting-consent">Collecting consent</h3>

<h4 id="providing-the-information-sheet">Providing the information sheet</h4>

<p>Give each participant a copy of the information sheet when they are being
recruited for a research session. Check which format and channel works best for
them - email attachment, paper letter, easy read, etc.</p>

<p>For a face to face research session, make sure you can provide a paper copy of
both the information sheet and the associated privacy statement/privacy policy,
if a participant asks for one.</p>

<h4 id="face-to-face-research-sessions">Face to face research sessions</h4>

<p>For user research sessions where you meet the participant in person, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>give the participant a printed copy of the consent form</li>
  <li>send the consent form in an accessible digital format the participant can read
using their assistive technology</li>
  <li>read the consent form aloud</li>
</ul>

<p>Check with the participant which format works best for them.</p>

<p>Give the participant the consent form as soon as you can. Make sure they have
time to read it carefully, and an opportunity to ask questions, before you ask
the participant to sign .</p>

<h4 id="remote-or-telephone-research-sessions">Remote or telephone research sessions</h4>

<p>For user research sessions where you will not meet the participant face to face,
you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>attach the consent form to an email in an accessible digital format</li>
  <li>send a paper consent form in the post</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask the participant to send a reply, confirming their consent. They can reply to
the email, or post back a signed paper consent form.</p>

<h4 id="during-the-session">During the session</h4>

<p>At the start of the session, remind the participant that their participation is
voluntary and they can stop or take a break at any time. Remind the participant
about the different ways you are recording the session, and about anyone
observing or listening in. Ask the participant to confirm their consent for the
recording.</p>

<p>As the session continues, actively make sure you have the participant’s consent.
For example, check in with the participant if they look concerned about an
activity, or if you’re on a visit and want to take a photo in a new area.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-a-record-of-consent">Keeping a record of consent</h3>

<p>For paper consent forms, scan or photograph the signed consent form and keep the
image file in the folder with the research data you collect in the session.</p>

<p>For email responses, keep a copy of the consent form and of the participant’s
reply in the folder with the research data you collect in the session.</p>

<p>Make sure the consent form, email reply and any research data have the same
participant identifier. Do not include participant names or other personal
identifiers in the document names.</p>

<h2 id="when-and-how-we-give-incentives-to-research-participants">When and how we give incentives to research participants</h2>

<p>It‘s normal to pay members of the public an incentive when they take part in
research activities with us.</p>

<p>This guidance explains how we agree incentives with clients and pay incentives
to participants.</p>

<p>It builds on the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/find-user-research-participants#giving-incentives">basic guidance on giving incentives</a>
in the Service Manual.</p>

<h3 id="who-gets-incentives">Who gets incentives</h3>

<p>We will normally pay incentives to members of the public, including people who
use a government service for their work. Professionals and members of groups may
not be comfortable with getting an incentive themselves, and may want the
incentive given to their organisation or donated to charity.</p>

<p>We do not expect to pay incentives to our clients‘ staff or to other public
servants who take part in research related to their work.</p>

<p>When we are paying an incentive, make sure the participant knows the amount of
the incentive and how they will receive it. Include this in the <a href="link to consent guidance">information
sheet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="agreeing-incentives">Agreeing incentives</h3>

<p>It’s best to include estimates of incentives and other research expenses in the
statement of work.</p>

<p>You can then confirm the exact incentive with the client when you are planning a
batch of research.</p>

<p>On previous project we have paid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>£30 of Love2Shop vouchers for 1.5 hours of in-person usability testing</li>
  <li>£50 cash for geographically-specific users to take part in 1 hour of remote
mobile usability testing</li>
  <li>£100 cash for an hour-long discovery research session with people likely to
need assisted digital support</li>
  <li>£100 cash for 45 minute research session with small businesses</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="confirming-incentives-at-the-start-of-the-research-session">Confirming incentives at the start of the research session</h3>

<p>Handle the incentive at the start of the research session - either giving the
incentive, or confirming that the incentive will be sent. This avoids any
suggestion that participants have to ‘earn’ their incentive. It also means you
don’t have to deal with the incentive if you want to stop a problematic session.</p>

<h3 id="paying-incentives-through-a-recruitment-agency">Paying incentives through a recruitment agency</h3>

<p>If you are using a recruitment agency, ask them to pay the incentive to the
participant. They will know how they do this. They may charge a small fee for
handling the incentive.</p>

<p>If a participant contacts dxw to say they haven’t received their incentive,
apologise and contact the agency to let them know.</p>

<h3 id="paying-incentives-using-shopping-vouchers">Paying incentives using shopping vouchers</h3>

<p>Where we are paying the incentive, we use shopping vouchers. Normally from
<a href="https://www.highstreetvouchers.com/gifts/love2shop-gift-vouchers">Love2shop</a>.</p>

<p>Request the amount of vouchers you need through the
<a href="https://dxw.slack.com/archives/C8ZGR2Y8Z">#help-purchasing</a> Slack channel and
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdz8-Z-fcootRS6UyceXbxdSdbO4-2jIyRrHHiI-3VH4LyRrw/viewform">purchasing form</a>.
They should be in £5 and £10 denominations so they are easier to spend.</p>

<p>In a face-to-face research session, give the vouchers to the participant and
have them
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-O9Qvp4kgs4t0JfQTIQF9dkiexv5mZtPNJfcxtmODZ0">sign a receipt</a>.</p>

<p>For a remote research session, ask for the vouchers to be posted or emailed to
the participant. When posting vouchers, enclose the vouchers with a signed
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=142Sf1QYH9wcySPf6GIOskv5qyJlc9phGZSeoCsxCoeU">thank you sheet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="other-ways-to-pay-incentives">Other ways to pay incentives</h3>

<p>Other options for paying incentives might be a donation to a preferred charity,
or a hamper that can be shared with a team.</p>

<h3 id="withholding-incentives">Withholding incentives</h3>

<p>We do not pay the incentive (or any recruitment fee) if the participant doesn’t
show up for their session. Although we might still pay the incentive if the
participant tries to attend, but is stopped by an emergency or severe travel
problem beyond their control.</p>

<p>If a recruitment agency provides a participant who does not match the brief, we
will pay the participant their incentive, but we will not pay the agency their
recruitment fee.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-take-notes-and-record-research-sessions">How we take notes and record research sessions</h2>

<p>To capture what happens in our research sessions we take notes and photos, make
audio, video and screen recordings, and take copies of paperwork and other
material that participants use or refer to.</p>

<p>We use these notes, photos and recordings during analysis to make sure we
produce valid findings. And we use extracted quotes, images and clips to
illustrate the findings we share.</p>

<p>There is good guidance on
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/taking-notes-and-recording-user-research-sessions">Taking notes and recording user research sessions</a>
in the Service Manual, and on
<a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2012/04/capturing-user-research.php">Capturing User Research</a>
in UX Matters.</p>

<p>Here we provide additional, specific guidance for researchers at dxw.</p>

<h3 id="good-practices-to-follow">Good practices to follow</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Capture only what you need and have consent for</strong></p>

    <p>Good user research practice, and good privacy practice, is to capture only
the data you believe you need. For example, don’t make a screen or video
recording, ‘just in case’, if you’ll only ever need a transcript of what the
participant says.</p>

    <p>Make sure that anything you capture during a session is covered by the
consent you’ve collected. If a participant changes their mind about what they
consent to, be prepared to not make, or to delete recordings you no longer
have consent for.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do not use your personal devices</strong></p>

    <p>Always use a dxw provided device, rather than your personal device, when
taking notes and photos, or making recordings.</p>

    <p>Using our own devices in research means that personal data about research
participants can be mixed into our personal data stores, like cloud photo
libraries. And also runs the risk of participants, client staff and
colleagues seeing our personal messages and images.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep your notes and recordings secure</strong></p>

    <p>As soon as possible after the session, transfer any notes and recordings from
paper and other devices to your dxw provided laptop. And from your laptop to
the dxw Google Drive or to the client’s research store.</p>

    <p>Keep only anonymised notes, quotes and images in tools like Miro and Trello.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have a fall back</strong></p>

    <p>The one certainty in user research is that things go wrong. So make sure you
have other options to capture what you need.</p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The participant may decide they don’t want to be recorded in a particular
way, so be prepared to switch from video to an audio-only recording, or to
just take notes</li>
      <li>Your preferred device, app or service may not be working properly, so have
an alternative like a paper notebook</li>
      <li>Your note taker, assistant or observer may not be able to join the session,
so be prepared to take notes and recordings yourself</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that if the participant refuses all recording, including note taking,
you may want to abandon the session.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="using-your-dxw-provided-laptop">Using your dxw provided laptop</h3>

<p>Whenever possible, use your dxw provided laptop for taking notes and making
recordings. Our laptops have encrypted drives and we follow good security
policies.</p>

<p>With your laptop you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>capture notes to a local file or a Google Sheet</li>
  <li>record audio using a microphone and the Voice Memos or Quicktime apps</li>
  <li>record video using an external camera and Quicktime</li>
  <li>record your laptop screen using Quicktime or Screenshot</li>
</ul>

<p>If research participants might use your laptop or see your screen during a
research session, it’s a good idea to create a separate ‘research’ user account
on your laptop with things like notifications and browser autofill turned off.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-dxw-provided-handheld-device">Using a dxw provided handheld device</h3>

<p>Use a dxw provided handheld device, rather than own phone or tablet, to take
photos and short videos during interviews, visits and workshops.</p>

<p>Remember to delete the photos and recordings from the device once you have
transfered them to your laptop or to Google Drive.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-notes-template">Using the notes template</h3>

<p>We have a
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r6xtVgHBFTDxbFGSqk3wXFDy_5JDwkBpGBHibnLKuwM">template for a Google Sheet</a>
you can use to take notes during a research session.</p>

<p>You can make a copy of the sheet for each research session, or make a copy for
each batch of research and create tabs within the sheet for each research
session.</p>

<h3 id="using-sticky-notes-and-paper-worksheets">Using sticky notes and paper worksheets</h3>

<p>We often use sticky notes and paper worksheets to capture information during
research sessions, for example when
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/researching-user-experiences">researching users’ experiences</a>.</p>

<p>Design paper worksheets, and give people advice on
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/taking-notes-and-recording-user-research-sessions#using-sticky-notes">writing sticky notes</a>,
so you can easily use the information recorded.</p>

<p>Avoid capturing personally identifiable information about participants on sticky
notes or paper. If you capture any sensitive informaton on sticky notes or
paper, make sure to use a shredder to dispose of it.</p>

<p>Use a dxw provided phone or tablet, rather than your personal device, to capture
the contents of sticky notes and paper worksheets.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-video-conferencing-service">Using a video conferencing service</h3>

<p>Our preferred service for recording remote screen sharing sessions is
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KiaXHr-VCX8T6K9YWPnmHHiAChJda_gH4av03N4pDrg/">GoToMeeting</a>.
Setup GoToMeeting so that the recorded video is saved onto your dxw provided
laptop. And then transfer the video to Google Drive as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Depending on the client, we may need to use their preferred video conferencing
service. If the service stores recordings ‘in the cloud’, make sure to download
the video as soon as possible and delete it from the service.</p>

<h3 id="using-third-party-facilities">Using third-party facilities</h3>

<p>If you are using a third party facility like a usability lab, transfer any
recordings made by the lab to your dxw provided laptop as soon as possible after
the sessions are complete.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-protect-participant-privacy">How we protect participant privacy</h2>

<p>When we do research, we must carefully manage participants’ contact details and
other personal data to protect their privacy and comply with the law.</p>

<p>This guidance explains how we collect and use information about research
participants at dxw. It builds on the general guidance on
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/managing-user-research-data-participant-privacy">managing participant privacy</a>
in the Service Manual.</p>

<h3 id="collecting-only-the-participant-details-we-need">Collecting only the participant details we need</h3>

<p>We collect as little information about participants as possible. And only the
information we really need to manage their participation. For example,
collecting just the participant’s name and email address to arrange a video
call.</p>

<p>When we use a screening questionnaire, we ask only the questions we need to
select participants. For example, we don’t ask for a date of birth if we only
need an age range.</p>

<p>We avoid keeping participants’ personal details as a record of who we spoke to,
or to manage subject access or deletion requests. We may keep counts of numbers
and types of participants, but these should not include any personal details.</p>

<h3 id="storing-participant-details-securely">Storing participant details securely</h3>

<p>We usually store participants’ details in the Google Drive folders for the
relevant project, for example in a spreadsheet in a Research subfolder. We limit
access to just the colleagues who need to use them to help people participate.</p>

<p>The Google Drive Help Center has a useful guide on ways to
<a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494893">stop, limit, or change sharing of files and folders</a>.</p>

<p>When using an online questionnaire tool to recruit and screen participants,
transfer the responses from the tool to Google Drive as soon as possible, and
securely delete the original responses from the tool.</p>

<p>When sending calendar invites to participants, we restrict access to the guest
list so that only colleagues involved in the research will see participants’
contact details.</p>

<p>We avoid sharing email conversations that include participants’ contact and
other personal details.</p>

<p>And we avoid sharing participants’ details in any other tool, such as Slack or
Trello.</p>

<h3 id="deleting-participant-details-when-no-longer-needed">Deleting participant details when no longer needed</h3>

<p>We delete participants’ details from Google Drive, Gmail and Calendar as soon as
we no longer need the details to manage their participation in research.</p>

<p>Labelling emails exchanged with participants is a good way to find and delete
them. For example, in Google Gmail you might create ‘Participant’ and ‘RODA’
labels and search for them using ‘label:(participant RODA)’.</p>

<p>Identifying calendar events that might contain participants’ details is not so
easy. In Google Calendar you can create a personal Research calendar and add all
research activities involving participants to that calendar. Or you might adopt
a naming convention such as ‘Research:’.</p>

<h3 id="doing-fully-confidential-research">Doing fully confidential research</h3>

<p>We sometimes do research where the participants are known only to the
researchers. Other members of the team will not know who participated in the
research.</p>

<p>When doing fully confidential research:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we strictly limit access to participant details</li>
  <li>use private meeting invites</li>
  <li>share only fully anonymised findings</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-we-take-care-of-research-data">How we take care of research data</h2>

<p>When we do research, we must manage the data we collect so that we protect
participants’ privacy and comply with the law.</p>

<p>This guidance explains how we manage research data at dxw. It builds on the
general guidance on
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/managing-user-research-data-participant-privacy">managing research data</a>
in the Service Manual. These is also useful advice in
<a href="https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/the-user-researchers-guide-to-gdpr">The User Researcher’s Guide to GDPR</a>.</p>

<h3 id="agreeing-who-controls-the-research-data">Agreeing who controls the research data</h3>

<p>There are two basic options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The client is the data controller for the research data, and we are a
processor.</p>

    <p>This is the best approach when we are working in a blended team for a client
with an established user research practice. It allows the client and team to
continue accessing and using the research data independent of dxw.</p>

    <p>In this case we use the client’s consent materials and store the research
data in their systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are the data controller for the research data, and we limit the client’s
access to the research data.</p>

    <p>This is the best approach when we are working in a dxw staffed team for a
client with a limited or no user research practice. It reduces the burden on
the client and reduces our dependence on their practices.</p>

    <p>In this case we use dxw consent materials and store the research data in our
systems along with the records of consent.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We will agree on the approach for the project as early as possible. Ideally as
part of the statement of work, but at the latest during inception.</p>

<h3 id="storing-research-data-securely">Storing research data securely</h3>

<p>We store research data that we control in the Client work area of the dxw Google
Drive.</p>

<p>We limit access to folders and files containing research data to colleagues who
need to access and use the data to complete their work.</p>

<p>The Google Drive Help Center has a useful guide on ways to
<a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494893">stop, limit, or change sharing of files and folders</a>.</p>

<p>When we capture research data on a device or in another online service, we move
the data to Google Drive as soon as possible, and securely delete the research
data from the device or service.</p>

<p>If moving research data to Google Drive is not immediately possible, we move the
data to our dxw provided laptop. For example, if we collect videos during pop-up
research at a location with no reliable Internet connection.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-records-of-consent">Keeping records of consent</h3>

<p>We store records of consent along with the research data they relate to.</p>

<p>The consent record might be a scan of a paper consent form, a saved copy of an
email, or some other suitable record.</p>

<p>We delete the consent record when we have deleted that participant’s research
data and contact details.</p>

<h3 id="identifying-research-data-clearly">Identifying research data clearly</h3>

<p>To identify research data in Google Drive, we follow our
<a href="#how-we-name-and-identify-documents">general file naming convention</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We keep research data in subfolders identified by the date of the research,
the project and the research activity. For example:</p>

    <p>2021 04 - Research - BEIS ODA - Observing the ODA QA process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We name individual files with the date collected, the project and the research
activity. For example:</p>

    <p>2021 04 - Notes - BEIS ODA - Observing the ODA QA process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If needed, we add participant numbers to identify the different data files
within a research activity. For example:</p>

    <p>2021 04 08 - P2 - Recording - BEIS ODA - Observing the ODA QA process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We use matching file names to keep records of consent. For example:</p>

    <p>2021 04 08 - P2 - Consent - BEIS ODA - Observing the ODA QA process</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Be careful not to use a participant’s personal details, such as their name or
organisation, to identify the data we collect during research activities.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-anonymised-extracts">Sharing anonymised extracts</h3>

<p>We often use extracts from research data to illustrate findings and other
project outputs. These extracts might be quotes, photos, video clips,
screenshots, or copies of artefacts like documents.</p>

<p>In any material that may go outside of the immediate team, we use only fully
anonymised extracts, where the participant cannot be identified.</p>

<p>The UK Data Service has useful guidance on
<a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/legal-ethical/anonymisation">anonymising both quantitative and qualitative research data</a>.</p>

<p>We sometimes do show identifiable extracts within a team, and where we have
consent. For example, showing clips from a usability testing session during a
closed playback with the team.</p>

<h3 id="deleting-research-data-when-no-longer-needed">Deleting research data when no longer needed</h3>

<p>We delete research data from Google Drive as soon as we no longer need it for
our work. Or at the latest by the end of the declared retention period, usually
1 year.</p>

<p>Research data files may be owned by different members of staff. To delete files
owned by colleagues, including those who have left dxw, contact the technical
operations team at #help-internal-tech-support.</p>

<h3 id="processing-access-requests-and-withdrawal-of-consent">Processing access requests and withdrawal of consent</h3>

<p>Participants can withdraw their consent or ask us to share any personal data we
have about them.</p>

<p>If a participant withdraws their consent, or if it is not clear that we have a
participant’s consent, then we must find and delete any personal data we have,
including notes, recordings, emails, calendar events, records in spreadsheets,
etc.</p>

<p>If a participant asks to see the personal data we have about them, then we must
find and share any personal data we have, including notes, recordings, emails,
calendar events, records in spreadsheets, etc.</p>

<p>To identify the participant’s data, we may need to ask them for details of the
research activities they were involved in.</p>

<p>And we may need to separate data about one participant from data about other
participants. For example, if we have notes or voice recordings from a group
workshop.</p>

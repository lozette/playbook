          <h1>Learning and development</h1>
          <p>We have an annual learning and development allowance of £1,000 and up to 4 days
per person.</p>

<p>You can use this for professional and personal development activities like
workshops, short courses or conferences.</p>

<p>You can also use the allowance to attend a non role based conference or event
focused on improving your health and wellbeing. You will receive two days off
for this, and can top up the time from your annual leave allowance.</p>

<p>We know that lots of training isn’t paid for, and involves things like coaching
and mentoring, learning from colleagues, being an active part of networks, and
other self-directed learning. We will encourage and support people who want to
use unbilled days for different types of professional development.</p>
